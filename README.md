The script works to merge and summarise the data provided

This is done by first identifying the collumns in the orginal data that are relevant

These collumns are then loaded into two seperate tables

These tables are then suplimented to include the Activity info and the Subject info.

These two tables are then merged into a single table

Finally a summary table is created with the averages of all the variables for each Activity and Subject.
